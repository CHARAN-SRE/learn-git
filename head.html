    Since Michael Hussey's retirement, Australia have struggled to find a reliable middle order batsman who can both anchor and finish an innings.
     There have been a few who have auditioned for the spot, some with brief success as well but the consistency hasn't been there for a longer duration.
    Travis Head is touted to be capable of being that man and there is a feeling that he can emerge as one of the country's finest middle-order batsmen in limited-overs cricket.
     His ticket to international fame in the 2015-16 BBL season when he smoked a century to take the Adelaide Strikers to a victory from out of nowhere against the Sydney Sixers. 
     An international debut followed within weeks as he was picked for the T20I series against India at home.
